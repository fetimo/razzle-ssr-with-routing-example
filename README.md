Two examples of using Razzle which expand on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jaredpalmer/a73bc00cac8926ff0ad5281879b1eb90). Both include routing with `react-router`.

`01_ssr` contains an example app with server-side rendering.
`02_ssr-with-redux` contains an example app with server-side rendering and Redux actions.

Each folder has it's own dependencies and it's own README.

Full credit to Jared Palmer, putting it together helped me wrap my head around it.
